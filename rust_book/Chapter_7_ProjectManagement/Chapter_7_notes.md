# Project Management w/Packages, Crates and Modules
* **Packages**: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
* **Crates**: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
* **Modules** and **use**: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
* **Paths**: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module

## Packages and Crates
* A crate is a binary or library
* Crate root is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from
* Package is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality (contains a `Cargo.toml` file)
* Cargo assumes that `src/main.rs` is the crate root for binary crates, `src/lib.rs` for library crates
* **Library crate** -> code to be used by other Rust code
* **Binary crate** -> code to be made into an executable


## Modules, Control Scope and Privacy
* _Modules let us organize code within a crate into groups for readability and easy reuse. Modules also control the privacy of items, which is whether an item can be used by outside code (public) or whether itâ€™s an internal implementation detail and not available for outside use (private)._
* Create a new library with
    ```
    cargo new --lib LIBNAME
    ```
* Modules create with the `mod` keyword
* In Rust, all items (functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private by default 
    * can change this using the `pub` keyword 
* Privacy cascades downwards
    * Access to a parent != access to a child
    * Acess to a child == access to a parent


### Paths
* A path can take two forms:
    * An absolute path starts from a crate root by using a crate name or a literal crate.
    * A relative path starts from the current module and uses self, super, or an identifier in the current module.
* Both types are separated with `::`

### Scope
* You can bring paths into scope with `use` (avoids long import statements)
        ```
        mod front_of_house {
            pub mod hosting {
                pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
            }
        }

        use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

        pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
            hosting::add_to_waitlist();
            hosting::add_to_waitlist();
            hosting::add_to_waitlist();
        }
        ```
* Functions
    * keep parent module in path `parent::function`
* Enums/structs/etc 
    * full path `element`
    * except if namespace clashes, then `module::element`


### Renaming 
* You can use `as` keyword
    ```
    use std::fmt::Result;
    use std::io::Result as IoResult;

    fn function1() -> Result {
        // --snip--
    }

    fn function2() -> IoResult<()> {
        // --snip--
    }
    ```
* Re-export names with `pub use`
    ```
    mod front_of_house {
        pub mod hosting {
            pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        }
    }

    pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
    ```

### Nesting Paths (Bulk imports)
* Multiple fns/modules
    ```
    use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
    ```
* Self + submodules
    ```
    //Instead of 
    use std::io;
    use std::io::Write;

    //Do
    use std::io::{self, Write};
    ```
* Everything
    ```
    use std::collections::*;
    ```
    
### Restaurant Example
* Front/back of house in restaurant each with different roles/tasks
* Nesting modules creates _families_
    * Children mods, parent mods, sibling mods etc.
* Functions defined in the same crate can be accessed using the `crate` keyword at the start of the path
    * `crate::front_of_house::...`
